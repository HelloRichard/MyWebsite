		<p id="intro">Howdy, Iâ€™m Richard Lim, and I am a sophomore chemical engineering student at Texas A&M University. I am seeking an internship as a maintenance and project engineer at an oil and gas industry. The purpose of this E-folio is to display my accomplishments and credentials. My experiences will demonstrate that I am adaptable, bright, and motivated individual. </p> </br>

		<h1>Adaptable</h1>
		<p>Adaptability plays a large role in the oil and gas industries. Adaptability is something that I am good at. I am able to adjust to any environment whether mentally or physically. I have experienced a lot of changes in my life. A mental adaptability I have faced is moving from a less educated environment to a more educated environment. As for a physical adaptability, the transaction from high school to college where moving from a nurtured lifestyle to an independent lifestyle</p>

		<h1>Bright</h1>
		<p>One of my strength is that I am a planer. I like to plan every step of my way. I always make sure I have a backup plan just in case something goes wrong. Therefore, I manage my time more efficiently. I have a love for practical applications rather than book applications because I am a visual learner. This is something I am looking forward to in the work environment because of the hands-on work. Because I like practical applications, I could not pass up on a research opportunity, the Aggie Challenge. This research gave me a chance to explore a new field. As a hobby, I like to take broken things and try to fix them or utilize them for benefit or knowledge, making me a critical thinker. Also when I approach a problem, I try to find multiply ways to solve it</p>

		<h1>Motivated</h1>
		<p>Working as a team is another one of my strengths because I am a team player. Team work is inevitable in the engineering; it is something that we have to adapt to. As a team player, I am always motivated to do my best because if I fail to do my best, my whole team fails. Therefore, not only do I have to motivate myself, but also motivate my teammates. Because I have this motive for perfection, I like to go beyond the expectation. I am also very competitive. My competitive personality is the main reason I am motivated to succeed in everything I do. The way I show my competitive personality is by setting weekly goals like beating my quiz grade from last week or simply working on homework earlier</p>
