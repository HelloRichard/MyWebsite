		<h1>Adaptable</h1>
		<p>Adaptability is essential to our lives because it helps us survive and makes us better. Anywhere we go, our mind and body needs to adapt to the environment whether it is physically or mentally. I have the mindset to adapt to any condition. Because I have the capacity to adapt, I enjoy challenges. If someone dares to challenge me, I will strive to win the challenge. I am one of those people who will not give up until the task or challenge is finished. Therefore, I know that I can work in any field and succeed.</p>

		<h1>Bright</h1>
		<p>Here are my strength: One of my strength is that I am a strategic planer. I like to plan every step of my way. I always make sure I have a backup plan, plan B and sometimes plan C, just in case something goes wrong. Having a game plan increases efficiency and productivity. I have a love for practical applications rather than book applications because I am a visual learner; this is why I majored in engineering. One of my greatest strength is that I am a critical thinker. When I approach a problem, I try to find the best solutions by determining different methods. This is why I enjoy programing and engineering because there are so many different solutions and methods to a problem.</p>

		<h1>Motivated</h1>
		<p>Motivation can hard sometimes. The best way to be motivated is to think optimistically. Just having self-motivation might not be enough. We have to be willing to motivate others, especially in the work environment. Every engineer should know that teamwork is inevitable and it is something we all have to adapt to. I always tell myself to do my best because if I fail, I don’t fail just myself, but also everyone else around me. Motivation can make me very competitive. My competitive personality is the main reason I am motivated to succeed in everything I do. Sometimes all we need is motivation.</p>
